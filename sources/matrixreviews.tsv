infores:string	Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins	3	Comprehensive gene/protein coverage with dense functional/physical associations and rich UniProt-based descriptors.	3	Global-scale, multi-species PPI/functional knowledgebase with millions of high-confidence edges from heterogeneous evidence.	3	Directly usable as a backbone for repurposing pipelines; confidence-scored PPI edges integrate seamlessly once drug and disease mappings are added.	High	Nominate: as gets A=3 / B=3/ C=3; pretty good source	High	STRING is highly relevant for repurposing and translational pharmacology because it captures the functional protein landscape that underlies drug action. By linking proteins in pathways, networks, and disease processes, it enables inference of indirect drug–disease relationships. The layered evidence and confidence scoring help distinguish biologically meaningful interactions from background noise, which is essential for pharmacology-driven hypotheses. Since drugs act through proteins, STRING provides the mechanistic bridge between drug targets and downstream phenotypes, making it a great source for evaluating new therapeutic opportunities	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:umls-metathesaurus	UMLS Metathesaurus (MTH) (from UMLS)	3	Covers diseases, drugs/chemicals, genes/genomes, anatomy, phenotypes, procedures, functions; concepts standardized to CUIs with 134 semantic types and 54 relation families.	3	Unifies ~60 vocabularies (~900k concepts) spanning clinical medicine and life sciences, from MeSH and SNOMED to NCBI Taxonomy and early GO integration.	2	Provides schema-level relations (e.g., ‘Pharmacologic Substance TREATS Disease or Syndrome’, ‘interacts with’) but not instance-level curated edges, so mainly useful for normalization and relation templates.	Medium	Conditional: due to a Utility score of 2	High	Although the rubric yields Conditional due to a Utility score of 2, UMLS is being elevated to Nominate status. Its unparalleled breadth across ~60 integrated vocabularies, extensive coverage of diseases, drugs, phenotypes, anatomy, and genomic entities, and its role as the canonical backbone for biomedical concept normalization make it a uniquely valuable resource. While it lacks curated instance-level D–D edges, its semantic network (134 semantic types, 54 relation families) provides strong relation templates and consistent categorization, enabling cross-walks and harmonization critical for downstream repurposing models—meriting Nmination despite a rubric-derived Conditional	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:semmeddb	Semantic Medline Database	2	Entities: drug,target,disease via UMLS CUIs; Relations: TREATS, INHIBITS, ASSOCIATED_WITH (~30 predicate types). Rich coverage but many edges generic/ambiguous.	3	Broad, cross-disease; >21M PubMed citations; 57.6M predications; thousands of drugs, diseases, genes; multi-relation subtypes	1	Direct edges: TREATS, INHIBITS, CAUSES, etc. present but NLP-extracted, noisy; predicates often generic; PubMed links but no confidence scores; precision ~70–80% → heavy filtering required	Medium	Conditional: with condition = “only use curated subsets (e.g., TREATS, INHIBITS) and filter by frequency/confidence	Medium	SemMedDB is a valuable pharmacology-facing resource because it systematically mines the biomedical literature to surface relationships among drugs, targets, and diseases. For pharmacology and repurposing work, this means one can quickly identify broad patterns of how drugs are reported to treat conditions, inhibit targets, or interact with biological processes across the entire PubMed corpus. The use of UMLS CUIs ensures standardized identifiers and allows integration with other biomedical datasets. However, because the relationships are automatically extracted via NLP rather than manually curated, there is considerable noise, and predicates are often generic. As a result, SemMedDB is best positioned as a hypothesis-generation tool rather than a plug-and-play backbone for drug–disease modeling. With careful filtering around higher-confidence predicates (e.g., TREATS, INHIBITS) and frequency thresholds, it can enrich repurposing pipelines by pointing to candidate mechanisms and literature support at scale	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:diseases	DISEASES	2	Entities: target,gene + disease; Relation: T–D (~millions); mapped to DOID, STRING/HGNC/Ensembl; confidence scoring robust. No drugs or D–D/AEs.	3	Broad, cross-disease; millions of T–D edges; >19k genes, >8k diseases; integrates curated, GWAS, text mining; updated weekly.	2	Direct edges: T–D; millions of associations; 1–5 star confidence; AUC=0.916 for text mining. No direct drug links, no mechanism or AE context → requires integration with drug–target DBs.	Medium	Conditional: useful for repurposing only when linked with other drug→target resources	Medium	The DISEASES database is highly relevant for pharmacology and translational research as it aggregates gene–disease associations from multiple evidence streams — curated resources, GWAS, and large-scale text mining. From a therapeutic perspective, this makes it a powerful backbone for connecting disease biology to molecular targets, especially since all entities are mapped to standardized identifiers (Disease Ontology, UniProt, HGNC, Ensembl). The built-in confidence scoring (1–5 stars) and benchmarking against gold standards lend reliability that is rare in large-scale association resources. For drug repurposing, DISEASES does not provide drug–disease edges directly, but it plays a crucial enabling role: drugs can be linked in through their known targets (via resources like DrugBank or ChEMBL), making D→T→D inference feasible at scale. This indirect but evidence-weighted connection between disease and targets provides a structured way to prioritize repurposing opportunities grounded in genetic and literature support. It is not a plug-and-play repurposing tool on its own, but it is an excellent, trustworthy foundation for building disease–gene–drug networks that support pharmacological hypothesis generation and drug repositioning	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:lincs	Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures	2	Entities: drugs + genes (genetic perturbations), disease mainly as context; relations are perturbation→signature (L1000, P100/GCP, imaging). Rich metadata/FAIR, but no native D–T/T–D/D–D edges	3	Broad, cross-disease & multi-modality (L1000, proteomics, imaging, epigenetics); tens of thousands of perturbagens; hundreds of thousands of signatures; large multi-center program; FAIR & standardized.”	2	Strong for signature-based D→D (reversal/mimic) via CLUE/L1000CDS2; toxicity signatures (DToxS) aid filtering. Lacks curated D–T/T–D/D–D edges; needs join to DrugBank/ChEMBL/BindingDB and disease resources.	Medium	Conditional: it’s a backbone-scale perturbation resource that’s excellent for signature-based repurposing and MOA illumination, but it must be joined to curated drug–target and disease sources to drive actionable D→D decisions.	Medium	The LINCS program is quite relevant to drug discovery and repurposing because it systematically catalogs how human cells respond to thousands of chemical and genetic perturbations across transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and imaging assays. From a pharmacology standpoint, this resource provides a unique way to understand mechanism of action, pathway involvement, and potential off-target or toxic effects. While LINCS does not natively contain curated drug–target or drug–disease links, its large-scale perturbation signatures [molecular response profile of a cell when it is exposed to a specific perturbation (e.g., a small molecule, genetic knockdown, overexpression, or other intervention)] serve as a critical hypothesis-generation layer. By integrating LINCS with drug–target resources (e.g., DrugBank, ChEMBL) and disease ontologies, one can systematically prioritize candidate therapies, explore polypharmacology, and filter out compounds with toxicity	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:chebi	Chemical Entity of Biological Interest	2	Rich ontology of small molecules with roles and structure descriptors; cross-referenced broadly; but lacks explicit gene/disease edges.	3	General-purpose backbone ontology of small molecules, roles, and classes; >400k entities; multi-resource integration; cross-disease, multi-use.	1	Great for harmonization (IDs, synonyms, chemical roles), but lacks curated D–T, T–D, or D–D edges; not plug-and-play for repurposing.	Medium	Conditional: a backbone ontology for chemical harmonization and roles, but requires integration with drug–target and disease resources to support repurposing models.	Medium	ChEBI is an essential foundation for biomedical informatics because it provides a rigorously curated ontology of small molecules, drugs, metabolites, cofactors, and xenobiotics, each linked with standardized identifiers (InChI, SMILES, INNs, synonyms) and roles such as “antineoplastic agent” or “analgesic.” From a pharmacology perspective, this makes it an amazing source for harmonizing chemical vocabularies across databases and for ensuring consistent mapping of drug entities when integrating resources like ChEMBL, DrugBank, or Reactome. However, ChEBI does not itself provide direct therapeutic relationships such as drug–target, target–disease, or drug–disease edges. Its value in repurposing therefore lies in its ability to unify chemical definitions, facilitate cross-resource linkage, and provide chemical role annotations that can serve as indirect signals of therapeutic potential. In practice, ChEBI acts as the chemical backbone of larger repurposing pipelines, enabling clean integration rather than producing repurposing hypotheses on its own	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
infores:mgi	Mouse Genome Informatics	2	Entities: gene, disease, phenotype; Relations: gene–phenotype (MP), mouse model→human disease (DO/OMIM), gene→GO, gene→expression (GXD); IDs: MGI/DO/MP/NCBI/PMID.	3	Backbone mouse resource; cross-disease; many phenotypes/models; multiple relation subtypes (phenotype, expression, GO, disease models); regular releases / bulk access.	2	Direct edges: T–D (mouse model→human disease) with PMIDs; IDs clean (DO/OMIM/NCBI/MGI). No D–T/D–D/AE—needs drug databases for D→T→D.	Medium	Conditional — Use MGI’s T–D as high-quality disease biology and gene-prior layer; combine with D–T from DrugBank/ChEMBL/BindingDB to run D→T→D paths. (Consider filtering to curated HMDC disease links.)	Medium	MGI provides well-curated links between mouse genes, phenotypes, and human diseasesusing standard ontologies and published evidence. This makes it a strong reference for understanding disease mechanisms and validating target–disease associations. For drug repurposing, MGI is most useful when combined with drug–target databases, since it does not include drugs directly. It supports the pathway from drug → target → disease by supplying reliable target–disease information	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-3395
